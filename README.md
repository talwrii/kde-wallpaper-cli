Set the wallpaper for KDE from the command-line.

## Attribution
The approach used here was [documented on stackoverflow](https://superuser.com/questions/488232/how-to-set-kde-desktop-wallpaper-from-command-line) and [this blogpost](https://www.gkbrk.com/change-kde-wallpaper-from-the-command-line) by Yaltirakli, which uses the same motivation.

## Motivation
It's so silly. It should be easy to set the wallpaper from the command-line. Also, I like to have as little of "my own" configuration as possible and instead push this into open source command-line tools so moving machines is useful.

Instead, the ["accepted" way of doing this](https://superuser.com/questions/488232/how-to-set-kde-desktop-wallpaper-from-command-line) seems to be send a script to KDE's plasmashell to update the wallpaper for each desktop.

## Alternatives and prior work
I tried [superpaper](https://github.com/hhannine/superpaper) but this did not work with [pipx](https://github.com/hhannine/superpaper/issues/142) without manual tweaks.

Tools like feh can set wallpaper for other window managers.
